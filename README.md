# Bidirectional Behavioral Sampling (Theory)
This codebase accompanies the paper "Bidirectional Behavioral Sampling: Understanding and Improving Action Chunking for Generative Behavioral Cloning".
The codebase contains one-dimensional diagnostic simulations to validate the theoretical analysis presented in the paper. 


1. ```1Dsimulations.ipynb``` runs 1D diagnostic simulations to validate the Consistency-Reactivity Inequalities, Corollary 2 and Corollary 3 from the paper. 

2. ```ContextValuableSimulation.ipynb``` validates Proposition 4 from the Appendix.
