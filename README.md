# Bidirectional Behavioral Sampling (Theory)
This codebase accompanies the paper "Bidirectional Behavioral Sampling: Understanding and Improving Action Chunking for Generative Behavioral Cloning".
The codebase contains one-dimensional diagnostic simulations to validate the theoretical analysis presented in the paper. 

1. PRsimulation.ipynb validates the Perception-Retention Inequality and Corollary 2 from the paper.
2. ContextValuableSimulation.ipynb validates Proposition 4 from the paper.
