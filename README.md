# Bidirectional Decoding (Theory)
This codebase accompanies the paper "Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop Resampling" by Yuejiang Liu*, Jubayer Ibn Hamid*, Annie Xie, Yoonho Lee, Maximilian Du, Chelsea Finn.
The codebase contains one-dimensional diagnostic simulations to validate the theoretical analysis presented in the paper. 


1. ```1Dsimulations.ipynb``` runs 1D diagnostic simulations to validate the Consistency-Reactivity Inequalities, Corollary 2 and Corollary 3 from the paper. 

2. ```ContextValuableSimulation.ipynb``` validates Proposition 4 from the Appendix.
